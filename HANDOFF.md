# Cross-Agent Handoff

Last updated: 2026-09-02 (Asia/Dubai)

## Goal and scope

Prepare and build a selection-quality AI Revenue Recovery Agent demo using the
requirements in `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`.

## Current state

- Shared workspace initialized.
- Original brief and official challenge image normalized into
  `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`.
- No tool research, architecture, dependencies, repository scaffolding, or
  implementation has begun.
- No repository exists yet.
- Current primary-source tooling research is saved in
  `TOOLING_RESEARCH.md`.
- Foundation architecture is saved in `FOUNDATION_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Case 1 is locked as a temporary subscription failure followed by a permitted
  wait, successful Razorpay test charge, verified webhook, and exact-once
  recovery accounting.
- The five-case batch is defined in `SCENARIO_MATRIX.md`: three common cases,
  one normally always-on-time customer, and one chronically late customer.
- Exact actions and deterministic rules are defined in `POLICY_SPEC.md`.
- Hermes cannot change commercial terms or account access. It can recommend an
  access hold only after deterministic conditions; real enforcement is outside
  the first demo.
- Claude's standing workflow is defined in `CLAUDE.md`: read this handoff first,
  load only relevant referenced context, update the handoff after each
  iteration, commit verified milestones, and push only when a remote exists.
- Claude Code Prompt 01 is delivered directly in the Codex chat rather than
  stored as a project file.
- Graphify was evaluated and deferred until a meaningful codebase exists; it
  maps code structure but does not replace product-decision handoffs.
- Status: Prompt 01 ready for Claude Code. No implementation has started yet.

## Decisions and invariants

- AI proposes recovery strategies; deterministic code enforces permissions and
  safety constraints.
- Optimize for deep behavior across 5–8 designed scenarios, not batch scale.
- Treat the 5–8 rich scenarios as an evaluation batch and show aggregate money
  recovered, satisfying the official judging bar.
- Razorpay test mode is the intended payment integration.
- Use free or meaningfully usable free-tier tooling where feasible.
- Keep the build selection-demo sized; avoid production overengineering.
- Do not treat any candidate action or technology as approved until discovery
  and research are complete.
- Internal delivery target is September 4 evening (Asia/Dubai assumed until
  confirmed); official September 5 cutoff time is unknown.
- The expected submission artifact includes a five-minute recorded demo.
- Razorpay test mode needs to be set up.
- Available model resources: ChatGPT Plus, OpenCode Go, and up to USD 22 in
  Gemini API credits if needed. Subscriptions must not be assumed to provide
  programmatic API access; research must verify usable runtime options.
- Synthetic customer history is allowed only where Razorpay does not expose the
  required context.
- Messaging is deferred until the core pipeline is defined; Telegram and email
  are candidates, not approved requirements.
- First-demo wedge: SaaS subscription-payment recovery, not B2B receivables.
- Product identity should be fictional but preferably adjacent to Razorpay's
  payment/SaaS domain.
- Start with one end-to-end case, then expand to at most five variable cases.
- Use an accelerated logical clock; do not make the demo wait through real
  recovery intervals.
- Recovery should be fully automated on normal paths. Policy-triggered stopping
  or human escalation must still exist because compliant escalation is part of
  the official judging bar.
- Synthetic enrichment is limited to useful data that a real SaaS/payment
  company could possess; no impossible or decorative omniscient fields.
- Core demo runs locally. A dashboard alone may be deployed and may communicate
  through a hosted database such as Neon, but Neon is not approved until
  research compares it against alternatives.

## Collaboration contract

- Claude Code owns 100% of implementation, without exception.
- Codex owns orchestration, current-tool research, planning, discussion with the
  user, architecture/specification, performance analysis, and critical review.
- Codex is the sole prompt provider to Claude Code.
- Codex must use `matt-skills-curated:writing-for-agents` when authoring or
  revising every Claude Code prompt. Prompts must use progressive disclosure,
  narrow scope, and observable completion criteria.
- Claude Code creates/retrieves implementation artifacts and evidence for Codex
  to assess. Codex must not duplicate implementation work.

## Open decisions

- Exact official deadline time; September 5, 2026 is assumed from current
  context but should be confirmed if the organizer publishes a year/time
- Judging rubric and selection criteria
- Whether outbound messaging is real or simulated
- Exact fictional SaaS identity and UI style

## Research recommendation (not yet an approved architecture)

- Local Python/FastAPI with the official Google GenAI SDK and Pydantic
- Gemini 3.7 Flash as the initial configurable runtime model
- Neon Postgres as shared state and business audit ledger
- Persisted accelerated logical clock; no external scheduler/job queue
- Streamlit locally for the dashboard
- zrok solely to expose the Razorpay webhook endpoint
- pytest and five hand-authored golden cases
- Provider-neutral message outbox; Telegram only as a stretch adapter
- See `TOOLING_RESEARCH.md` for facts, citations, limits, and rejected tools

## Architecture foundation

- Local modular monolith
- One deep `RecoveryEngine` module with `receive`, `run`, and `inspect`
- Webhook intake persists first and never waits on Gemini
- AI returns a typed proposal; deterministic policy authorizes all effects
- Neon stores current projections plus append-only audit history
- External effects use a transactional outbox and stable idempotency keys
- See `FOUNDATION_ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full contract

## Suggested skills

- `matt-skills-curated:research` for current, primary-source tool research
- `matt-skills-curated:grill-me` if requirements remain ambiguous
- `matt-skills-curated:to-spec` after decisions are settled
- `matt-skills-curated:to-tickets` for Claude Code implementation tasks
- `matt-skills-curated:code-review` when reviewing Claude Code output

## Secrets policy

Never write API keys, Razorpay secrets, webhook secrets, credentials, or private
authentication headers into this folder. Use environment variables and provide
only a redacted `.env.example` when implementation begins.

## Exact next action

Open the shared directory in Claude Code and paste Prompt 01 from the active
Codex chat. After Claude returns, Codex must inspect its diff, commit, tests, and
updated handoff before issuing Prompt 02.
